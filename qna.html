            <p class = "text">
              Although Hand Interfaces was only tested on the Oculus Quest, it was developed in the Unity engine. As such, Hand Interfaces is compatible with
              any AR/VR headset that supports Unity applications and hand tracking, of which many modern devices do.

              <span class = "highlight-text"><span class = "text-italic">How do I come up with new designs?</span></span>
            </p>
            <p class = "text">
              Keeping the criteria discussed in the Overview in mind, new designs can often be inspired by everyday activity. Try thinking of what interfaces or tools you use 
              throughout your day and their static/dynamic characteristics. Then, compare that with your hands and find a way to imitate those characteristics to your best ability.
              If the design fits the criteria, you might have just come up with a new design!

            <p class = "text">
              Yes, two user studies focused on object retrieval and interactive control were conducted. Each user study consisted of 17 participants with ages ranging from 19 to 39. 
              We collected age, gender, education level, major, VR experience level, handedness, and hand size information from participants before each study started. 
              The study was conducted in a quiet lab environment moderated by two experimenters. 
              If you want to know more about the user studies, please refer to our paper.
